Thank you for reviewing this Terrain Generator Project

Use th two buttons in the top right corner to cycle and refresh the scene, 
it is based on real time however the sunrise and set times are hardcoded.

The white panel was going to house my information, similar to my CV.

The project is built in that view port intentionally so that I could add multiple projects and switch between then while
displaying my information.
